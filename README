Getting Started:

 - Ensure you have PostGREs running
 - For Cucumber you will need to install the chromedriver from http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list

$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:test:prepare

Running without ActiveAdmin:
 - Due to a memory leak in development mode, we've setup a dev environment that avoids loading ActiveAdmin
 - To run a command against that environment, you just need to prefix the command with the 'frontend' env, e.g.:
    $ RAILS_ENV=frontend rails s
    ** While we wait on an ActiveAdmin update, you'll want to use thin as your development server **

Generating HTML output for Cucumber:
$ cucumber features --format html --out public/cucumber.html
